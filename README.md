# ADB Clash Royale Bot



### Requirements

 * ADB Installed
 * (Rooted? - Unsure) Android Device


### Possible Issues
 * Coding was done with a device screen resolution of 1080 by 1920. If your resolution is not this, the bot may not be able to map out button locations. Don't worry - you can still use adb command line to change the screen resolution and try again.
 * Coding was done based on certain colors being visible. Night Shift and other settings that alter the color of the framebuffer/screen may cause the app to not properly recognize the color.
